# questions
1. Yes. Determine the position of backticks. If backticks are between parentheses, ignore them. If not, ignore the substring between two backticks. 
2. Yes. We can use a stack to store the position of brackets and parentheses. Then we only consider the outer brackets and parentheses. 
3. Yes. We can locate the new line first. If there is a new line between brackets, we do not consider the link syntax anymore. If only one new line exists between parentheses, we ignore the new line symbol in the link.
