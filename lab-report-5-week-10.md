# **How I found the tests with different results**
I used the compare function in Visual Studio Code. With this function, I can see the difference between two files from the graphic vision, where differences are labelled with green and red color. I think it is clearer than using `diff` command in the terminal. 

# **For the first test**
![result](https://github.com/litianqing2887/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/should1.png?raw=true)
The result on the right is correct. There is a space in the middle of the link, so it is not a valid link. 
![fix1](https://github.com/litianqing2887/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/fix1.png?raw=true)
For the MarkdownParse of our group, we should determine if there is any space in the middle of two parentheses in the while loop.
